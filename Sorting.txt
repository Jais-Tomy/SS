Start the program.
Define the data segment and initialize variables, including a message to prompt the user to enter the count of numbers and an array to store the input numbers.
Define the code segment and assume that the code and data segments are located in the CS and DS registers, respectively.
Prompt the user to enter the count of numbers to be sorted and read the input using the INT 21H interrupt.
Verify that the input count is valid (i.e., greater than zero) and handle any errors if necessary.
Prompt the user to enter the numbers one by one, using a loop to read each input and store it in the array.
Verify that each input is valid (i.e., within a specified range of values) and handle any errors if necessary.
Perform the Bubble Sort algorithm on the array:
a. Use nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are out of order.
b. Continue the comparison and swapping process until the entire array is sorted.
c. Optimize the algorithm by exiting early if the array is already sorted.
Verify that the output array is valid and handle any errors if necessary.
Print out the sorted array, using another loop to iterate through the array and print each element.
Verify that the output has been printed correctly and handle any errors if necessary.
Provide the user with options to repeat the program or exit, using a loop to read the user's input and handle their choice.
Verify that the user's input is valid and handle any errors if necessary.
If the user chooses to repeat the program, return to step 4. If the user chooses to exit, end the program using an INT 21H interrupt.
